When our model is not too complex we tend to have higher bias and low variance. On the other hand if we increase the complexity by adding more features, it might be able to have less bias and lower the chance of a wrong prediction but being too specific and having learn very specific thigns might make our variance increase when it encounters small discrepencies in the new data passed to it.

The main differences between the two supervised machine learning techniques (classification and regression) are: regression predicts the output using a given continous input but in order to do this the data has to be labeled into dependent and independent variables. On the other hand, classification is looking to take the data and group it into binary clearly defined categories in the model. We use logistic regression when we want to predict a binary outcome ex: live or die based on multiple features(age, sex, ect). Next we have clustering which is unsupervised which means it will require less training and supervision. Clustering will take a set of data and group it according to similaries with one another. It wil create as many clusters as it is asked to which can be good or back depending on the type of data we have. Lasly, Hybrid will apply when we need to do a mix of both supervised and unsupervised techniques in order to achieve a sucessful model. classification is."
