    "I want to compare the number of people that were affected (based on the population of that time) and perhaps try to find a trend as to why they were affected. I will like to focus on the ones I find the most information on and narrow it down to the top 3 to focus on. \n",

    "I am very interested on the community and will like to learn more about what has affected and is affecting USA at this moment. By having a better knowledge at previous pandemics then I might be able to cathegorize the impacts the most recent pandemic (Covid-19) have.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How:\n",
    "I want to use at least 2 datasets from https://data.world/datasets/disease and https://data.cdc.gov/ and convine the data to have a better senses of how many cases of each pandemic were reported and when. I want to compare the number of people that were affected (based on the population of that time) and perhaps try to find a trend as to why they were affected."
