    "The four main algorithms techniques that we can use in machine learning are classification, regression, clustering and hybrids. The firrst two are considered supervised machine learning while the third unsupervised. Making the last one a mix of both. The main differences between the two supervised machine learning techniques (classification and regression) are: regression predicts the output using a given input but in order to do this the data has to be labeled into dependent and independent variables. On the other hand, classification is looking to take the data and group it into specific categories defined by the model. Next we have clustering which is unsupervised which means it will require less training and supervision. Clustering will take a set of data and group it according to similaries with one another. It wil create as many clusters as it is asked to which can be good or back depending on the type of data we have. Lasly, Hybrid will apply when we need to do a mix of both supervised and unsupervised techniques in order to achieve a sucessful model. classification is: **descrite(9clearly defined categories) vs continous(range of numbers). The space in between.  --> score: confience level: % of chance that x predicts y value"

    "As stated abocve sometimes we need a hybrid of both supervised and unsupervised machine learning but if we need to do just one of them there are clear differences between them. In order to do supervised learning we need to clearly define/label which feature will be the dependent(output) and all the independents (input or inputs). Also there will be human interaction with the model, meaning that if the model need tweeking we must do this manually to find the best model with the least errors. On the other hand, unsupervised learning doesn't need labeling. Instead it uses the algorithm to optimize the clustering until the most similarities between the data are found. "

    "Linear regression would be used in the instance where we want to find a correlation between an input and an output. For instance if we wanted to check if there is a correlation between growth of a plant and the amount of water it's given. We might hypothesize that the more water it gets the more it will grow, making growth the dependent variable. We tend to use scatter plots to view the relationship and if we see a \"linear relationship\" then we will go ahead and do a linear regression model on it. First, we will need to label at least one independent variable and only one dependent variable. Using Sklearn we will first split the total sample in 4 groups: 2 test (x and y) and 2 train (x and y). Second we will make a linear regression model. Third, pass the train x data in the linear model and give us a score.Fourth, we will pass our test x data to make y predictions. FInally, we will compare our y predictions to our actuals to find how accurate our model is. "

    "I would use logistic regression when we have a binary outcome meaning that there are two possibilities to the outcome we want to predict. For example the possibility of someone passing or failing. The reason it has to be binary it's because the model only produce a 1 or 0 outcome. If we graph the database/csv and notice a sydmoid relationshiop, we will want to explore doing a logictic regression on it. We also have to keep in mind that sometimes the relationship might not be clear in the graph so it might not show a perfect sydmoid graph. The process is very similar to linear regression as it will take the data split it into 4 variables. Next it will make a logistic regression instance form the sklearn library which will run fit on the data using the x_train and y_train to predict the classifications."

    "The Bias-variance tradeoff refers to the process of balancing variability and bias. Variability is an error where our model is too sensitive to minor changes in the training set. This occurs when the model has been overfitted and is only used to our original dataset. On the other hand, Bias is an error caused by incorrect assumptions in our learning algorithm that causes our model to not detect the relationship between features and target outputs. It's difficult to balance both and we ideally sant to choose a model that accurately captures the regularities of our training data but also generalizes well to unseen data."

If the score is higher than 0.70 it usually means that the line is a good fit for our data. The closer our $R^{2}$ is to zero usually means that our model might not be so accurate at predicting the output. "

This table is composed of 4 values: True positives(we predicted positive and it was positive), True Negative(we predicted negative and it was negative), False positive(we predicted positive and it was negative) and lastly False negative(we. predicted negative and it was positive). By analysing this we can visualize how many we got TP and TN.   "
